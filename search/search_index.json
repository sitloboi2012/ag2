For example, the inference requires instantiating a client, instead of using a global class method. Therefore, some changes are required for users of <code>pyautogen&lt;0.2</code>.</p> <ul> <li><code>api_base</code> -&gt; <code>base_url</code>, <code>request_timeout</code> -&gt; <code>timeout</code> in <code>llm_config</code> and <code>config_list</code>. <code>max_retry_period</code> and <code>retry_wait_time</code> are deprecated. <code>max_retries</code> can be set for each client.</li> <li>MathChat is unsupported until it is tested in future release.</li> <li><code>autogen.Completion</code> and <code>autogen.ChatCompletion</code> are deprecated. The essential functionalities are moved to <code>autogen.OpenAIWrapper</code>:</li> </ul> <pre><code>from autogen import OpenAIWrapper\nclient = OpenAIWrapper(config_list=config_list)\nresponse = client.create(messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"2+2=\"}])\nprint(client.extract_text_or_completion_object(response))\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Inference parameter tuning and inference logging features are updated: <pre><code>import autogen.runtime_logging\n\n# Start logging\nautogen.runtime_logging.start()\n\n# Stop logging\nautogen.runtime_logging.stop()\n</code></pre> Checkout Logging example notebook to learn more.</li> </ul> <p>Inference parameter tuning can be done via <code>flaml.tune</code>. - <code>seed</code> in autogen is renamed into <code>cache_seed</code> to accommodate the newly added <code>seed</code> param in openai chat completion api. <code>use_cache</code> is removed as a kwarg in <code>OpenAIWrapper.create()</code> for being automatically decided by <code>cache_seed</code>: int | None. The difference between autogen's <code>cache_seed</code> and openai's <code>seed</code> is that:   - autogen uses local disk cache to guarantee the exactly same output is produced for the same input and when cache is hit, no openai api call will be made.   - openai's <code>seed</code> is a best-effort deterministic sampling with no guarantee of determinism. When using openai's <code>seed</code> with <code>cache_seed</code> set to None, even for the same input, an openai api call will be made and there is no guarantee for getting exactly the same output.</p>"},{"location":"docs/contributor-guide/Research/","title":"Research","text":"<p>For technical details, please check our technical report and research publications.</p> <ul> <li>AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework.

AutoGen provides a more general conversation pattern called group chat, which involves more than two agents.</p> <p>The core idea of group chat is that all agents contribute to a single conversation thread and share the same context.</p> <p>This is useful for tasks that require collaboration among multiple agents.</p> <p>The figure below illustrates how group chat works.</p> <p></p> <p>A group chat is orchestrated by a special agent type <code>GroupChatManager</code>. In the first step of the group chat, the Group Chat Manager selects an agent to speak. Then, the selected agent speaks and the message is sent back to the Group Chat Manager, who broadcasts the message to all other agents in the group.</p> <p>This process repeats until the conversation stops.</p> <p>The Group Chat Manager can use several strategies to select the next agent.</p> <p>Currently, the following strategies are supported:</p> <ol> <li><code>round_robin</code>: The Group Chat Manager selects agents in a round-robin    fashion based on the order of the agents provided.</li> <li><code>random</code>: The Group Chat Manager selects agents randomly.</li> <li><code>manual</code>: The Group Chat Manager selects agents by asking for human input.</li> <li><code>auto</code>: The default strategy, which selects agents using the Group Chat    Manager's LLM.</li> </ol> <p>To illustrate this pattern, let's consider a simple example of a group chat among the same arithmetic operator agents as in the previous example, with the objective of turning a number into a specific target number using a sequence of arithmetic operations powered by the agents.</p> <p>In this example, we use the <code>auto</code> strategy to select the next agent.</p> <p>To help the Group Chat Manager select the next agent, we also set the <code>description</code> of the agents.

In\nthis work, we investigate the potential of large language models to generate\npatient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data\non the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we\ndevelop a rigorous labeling protocol for hallucinations, and have two medical\nexperts annotate 100 real-world summaries and 100 generated summaries. We show\nthat fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations\nfrom 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant\ninformation. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for GPT-4\nwhen prompted with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative\nevaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. GPT-4 shows\nvery good results even in the zero-shot setting. We find that common\nquantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.\nFinally, we test GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection, which yields\npromising results.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScientist (to chat_manager):\n\nBased on the abstract provided, the paper titled \"A Data-Centric Approach To Generate Faithful and High Quality Patient Summaries with Large Language Models\" explores the use of large language models, including GPT-4, to generate patient summaries from doctors' notes. The study focuses on the impact of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries and also investigates the potential of GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection.\n\n**Potential Applications in Software:**\n\n1. **Healthcare Documentation Automation:**\n   - GPT-4 could be used to develop software that assists healthcare professionals in creating accurate and comprehensive patient summaries by automatically processing doctors' notes and other medical records.\n\n2. **Clinical Decision Support Systems:**\n   - Integrating GPT-4 into clinical decision support systems could provide healthcare workers with insights and suggestions based on a patient's medical history, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment planning.\n\n3. **Patient Education and Communication:**\n   - Software applications could leverage GPT-4 to translate complex medical information into patient-friendly summaries, enhancing patient understanding of their health conditions and treatments.\n\n4. **Medical Training and Simulation:**\n   - GPT-4 could be used to create realistic medical scenarios for training medical students and professionals, simulating patient interactions and generating case studies.\n\n5. **Data Quality Assurance:**\n   - The paper suggests that GPT-4 can be used for automatic hallucination detection, which refers to the identification of inaccuracies or fabrications in generated text. This could be applied to software that ensures the quality and reliability of medical documentation.\n\n6. **Research and Development:**\n   - GPT-4 could assist researchers in summarizing and synthesizing large volumes of medical literature, aiding in the discovery of new insights and the development of novel treatments.\n\n7. **Personalized Health Monitoring:**\n   - Software applications could use GPT-4 to provide personalized health monitoring and advice by analyzing user input, such as symptoms or lifestyle factors, and generating tailored health recommendations.\n\nThese potential applications highlight the versatility of GPT-4 in the realm of healthcare software, offering opportunities to enhance patient care, improve healthcare workflows, and support medical education and research.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdmin (to chat_manager):\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/groupchat/custom-group-chat/#2-specified-flows-using-graphs","title":"2.

Adding this information will support a deeper understanding of the topic and ensure compliance with state educational standards.\n\n2. **Interactive Activities**: While creating a model of the solar system is a great hands-on activity, consider including additional interactive elements such as a group discussion or a game that reinforces the learning objectives. For instance, incorporating a \"planet facts\" game where students can share interesting facts about each planet would further engage the students and foster collaborative learning.\n\n3. **Assessment of Learning**: It would be beneficial to include a formative assessment to gauge students' understanding at the end of the lesson. This could be a quick quiz, a group presentation about one planet, or a drawing activity where students depict their favorite planet and share one fact about it.

Large 2 represents not just an incremental improvement but a transformative leap in text generation capabilities, setting new benchmarks for coherence, contextual understanding, and creative expression.\n\nUnlike Sonnet, which focuses heavily on understanding and reasoning, Large 2 excels in both comprehension and the nuanced generation of text that is indistinguishable from human writing. This balance allows Large 2 to produce content that is not only insightful but also incredibly engaging and natural, making it an invaluable tool across a broad spectrum of applications.\n\nThe potential of Large 2 extends far beyond traditional text generation. It can revolutionize fields such as content creation, customer service, marketing, and even personalized learning experiences. Our model's ability to adapt to various contexts and generate contextually rich responses makes it a versatile and powerful tool for any industry looking to harness the power of AI.\n\nWhile we appreciate the competition from Anthropic, we firmly believe that Large 2 stands at the forefront of AI innovation. The future of AI is not just about understanding and reasoning; it's about creating content that resonates with people on a deep level. With Large 2, Mistral is paving the way for a future where AI-generated text is not just functional but also profoundly human-like.\n\nPass to the judge.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: judge\n\njudge (to chat_manager):\n\n\n\nAfter carefully evaluating the arguments presented by both sonnet_agent and mistral_agent, I have reached a decision.\n\nBoth Anthropic's Sonnet and Mistral's Large 2 have demonstrated remarkable advancements in text generation capabilities, showcasing the potential to revolutionize various industries and transform the way we interact with AI.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, I find that mistral_agent's argument presents a more convincing case for why Large 2 stands at the forefront of AI innovation. The emphasis on balance between comprehension and nuanced generation of text that is indistinguishable from human writing sets Large 2 apart. This balance is crucial for creating content that is not only insightful but also engaging and natural, making it a versatile tool across a broad spectrum of applications.\n\nFurthermore, mistral_agent's argument highlights the potential of Large 2 to revolutionize fields beyond traditional text generation, such as content creation, customer service, marketing, and personalized learning experiences. This versatility and adaptability make Large 2 a powerful tool for any industry looking to harness the power of AI.\n\nIn contrast, while sonnet_agent's argument showcases the impressive capabilities of Sonnet, it focuses heavily on understanding and reasoning, which, although important, may not be enough to set it apart from Large 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the arguments presented, I conclude that Mistral's Large 2 has the potential to revolutionize the field of AI more significantly than Anthropic's Sonnet.\n\nTERMINATE.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: code_interpreter\n</code></pre> And there we have it, a number of different LLMs all collaborating together on a single cloud platform.</p>"},{"location":"docs/user-guide/models/amazon-bedrock/#image-classification-with-anthropics-claude-3-sonnet","title":"Image classification with Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet","text":"<p>AG2's Amazon Bedrock client class supports inputting images for the LLM to respond to.</p> <p>In this simple example, we'll use an image on the Internet and send it to Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet model to describe.</p> <p>Here's the image we'll use:</p> <p></p> <p><pre><code>config_list_sonnet = {\n    \"config_list\": [\n        {\n            \"api_type\": \"bedrock\",\n            \"model\": \"anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0\",\n            \"aws_region\": \"us-east-1\",\n            \"aws_access_key\": \"[FILL THIS IN]\",\n            \"aws_secret_key\": \"[FILL THIS IN]\",\n            \"cache_seed\": None,\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n# We'll use a Multimodal agent to handle the image\n\nimport autogen\nfrom autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent\nfrom autogen.agentchat.contrib.multimodal_conversable_agent import MultimodalConversableAgent\n\nimage_agent = MultimodalConversableAgent(\n    name=\"image-explainer\",\n    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,\n    llm_config=config_list_sonnet,\n)\n\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n    name=\"User_proxy\",\n    system_message=\"A human admin.\",\n    human_input_mode=\"NEVER\",\n    max_consecutive_auto_reply=0,\n    code_execution_config={\n        \"use_docker\": False\n    },  # Please set use_docker=True if docker is available to run the generated code.

Then, it initializes a variable `prime_count` to 0. It iterates through numbers from 1 to 10000 using a for loop. For each number, it calls the `is_prime(n)` function. If the function returns True, indicating that the number is prime, it increments the `prime_count` by 1.

Blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered more easily than other colors, which is why the sky appears blue during a clear day.\n\nHowever, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or purple due to a different type of scattering called scattering by dust, pollutants, and water droplets, which scatter longer wavelengths of light more effectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to agent.

This additional distance results in more scattering of sunlight, which preferentially scatters the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) more than the shorter wavelengths (blue and green).\n\nThe scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere causes the red, orange, and yellow colors to be more prevalent in the sky during sunrise and sunset, resulting in the beautiful display of colors often referred to as a sunrise or sunset.\n\nAs the sun continues to set, the sky can transition to various shades of purple, pink, and eventually dark blue or black, as the available sunlight continues to decrease and the longer wavelengths are progressively scattered less effectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide feedback to agent.

Detecting AI-generated images is crucial for\nmitigating these risks. Detection methods can be broadly categorized into\npassive and watermark-based approaches: passive detectors rely on artifacts\npresent in AI-generated images, whereas watermark-based detectors proactively\nembed watermarks into such images.

One crucial obstacle for\nlarge-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this\npaper, we argue that videos contain much more redundant information than\nimages, thus can be encoded by very few motion latents based on a content\nimage.

Since the output\nfrom LLMs propagate to downstream steps, identifying LLM errors is crucial to\nsystem performance. A common task for LLMs in AI systems is tool use. While\nthere are several benchmark environments for evaluating LLMs on this task, they\ntypically only give a success rate without any explanation of the failure\ncases.

Based on their titles and summaries, one of the papers that stands out for its potential application in software is:\n\n**Title:** SpecTool: A Benchmark for Characterizing Errors in Tool-Use LLMs\n**Authors:** Shirley Kokane, Ming Zhu, Tulika Awalgaonkar, Jianguo Zhang, Thai Hoang, Akshara Prabhakar, Zuxin Liu, Tian Lan, Liangwei Yang, Juntao Tan, Rithesh Murthy, Weiran Yao, Zhiwei Liu, Juan Carlos Niebles, Huan Wang, Shelby Heinecke, Caiming Xiong, Silivo Savarese\n**Published:** 2024-11-20\n\n**Summary of the paper's content:**\nThe paper discusses the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used in compound AI systems, particularly focusing on tool-use. It highlights the importance of identifying and characterizing errors in LLM outputs, as these errors can propagate to downstream tasks, potentially impacting overall system performance. The authors introduce \"SpecTool,\" a benchmark designed to evaluate and understand LLM errors in the context of tool-use tasks, aiming to provide explanations of failure cases rather than just success rates.\n\n**Potential applications in software:**\n- **Error Characterization:** The benchmark can be utilized by developers and researchers to better understand the types of errors LLMs may produce when integrated into software applications, allowing for more effective debugging and refinement of AI systems.\n- **Performance Optimization:** By providing insights into error patterns and causes, SpecTool can aid in optimizing the performance of LLM-driven software solutions.\n- **Tool-Use Evaluation:** This paper's methodologies can be applied in evaluating LLMs used in various software tools, ensuring reliability and robustness.\n- **Development of Advanced AI Systems:** The insights gained from using SpecTool can lead to the development of more sophisticated AI systems that effectively integrate LLMs, enhancing their tool-use capabilities.\n\nThis analysis highlights the potential impact of the SpecTool benchmark on enhancing software applications that rely on large language models for performing complex tasks. Let me know if further investigation is needed or any other steps should be taken.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: AccuracyVerification_Expert\n\nAccuracyVerification_Expert (to chat_manager):\n\nThe chosen paper \"SpecTool: A Benchmark for Characterizing Errors in Tool-Use LLMs\" seems highly relevant to the task of integrating large language models into software applications, given its focus on error evaluation and tool-use tasks.\n\nTo ensure accuracy in our findings:\n\n1. **Backward Reasoning Verification**: Let's consider the implications of potential inaccuracies in tool-use LLMs and verify that SpecTool is indeed addressing these concerns effectively through comprehensive benchmarks rather than just providing a success rate.\n\n2. **Test Case Proposal**: Develop a hypothetical scenario where a software application employing LLMs utilizes SpecTool to evaluate and mitigate errors. Verify whether the framework proposed in the paper can feasibly identify and explain failure cases.\n\nIf these steps confirm the potential benefits and applications of SpecTool, we can consider the task complete. Shall we proceed with this verification process to ensure thoroughness?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: Computer_terminal\n\nComputer_terminal (to chat_manager):\n\nThere is no code from the last 1 message for me to execute.

The LLM is integrated into a development environment and evaluated using SpecTool for errors in tool-use contexts.\n\n2. **Evaluation with SpecTool**:\n   - Implement a series of automated code review tasks using the LLM.\n   - Use SpecTool to benchmark these tasks by analyzing common errors in tool-use, focusing on error propagation and reliability of suggestions.\n   - Document each failure case and observe how SpecTool provides explanations and insights into the errors.\n\n3. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - SpecTool should identify specific error types in the code review suggestions made by the LLM.\n   - It should provide a breakdown of why certain suggestions are incorrect, allowing developers to tweak model parameters or retrain the LLM to enhance performance.\n\nBy confirming that SpecTool can effectively provide these insights, we affirm its application in improving software tools that incorporate LLMs. This ensures the benchmark's role in identifying, characterizing, and mitigating errors, thereby optimizing the software's functionality.\n\nIf the hypothetical outcomes align with these expectations, it substantiates the paper's potential contributions to software applications. Would this approach suffice for verifying our analysis?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExpert_summoner (to CaptainAgent):\n\nExpert_summoner (to CaptainAgent):\n\n***** Response from calling tool (call_cRl9ILRe8IGQlq78hC2iLAEV) *****\n# Response from seek_agent_help:\n## Task\nThe task is to find a recent paper about large language models on arXiv and analyze its potential applications in software.

For example, papers that explore the use of LLMs for personalizing content should be in the NLP category, even if they employ techniques from other domains.\n   - Cross-verify the abstracts of the papers to ensure accurate domain placement.\n\n2. **Review of Emerging Trends**:\n   - Identify if there are papers focusing on novel LLM applications that fall outside traditional domains, suggesting emerging fields.\n   - Pay attention to methodologies or frameworks that aim to integrate LLMs with other AI technologies, such as reinforcement learning or multi-modal systems.\n\n3. **Future Research Directions**:\n   - Consider if there are cross-references in the papers to unresolved challenges or limitations, which can guide future work.\n   - Ensure to highlight interdisciplinary potential, especially in fields like healthcare or environmental monitoring, where LLM applications can have significant impact.\n\n4. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Double-check any URLs, author names, and publication dates against the original entries to ensure all the information is correct in the markdown table.\n   - Verify that the markdown table is well-organized and all columns align properly for better readability and understanding.\n\nLet's ensure each of these points is accounted for before finalizing the results. If needed, we can provide specific test cases or scripts to verify particular details for accuracy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: Academic_Organization_Expert\n\nAcademic_Organization_Expert (to chat_manager):\n\nTo address the accuracy points raised by the DataAccuracy_Expert, let's proceed with the following verifications:\n\n1. **Verification of Domain Categorization**:\n   - Review the abstracts of the selected papers to verify their primary domains. This will ensure that the classification is based on the core focus of each paper.\n\n2. **Review of Emerging Trends**:\n   - Check for papers that introduce new LLM applications or methodologies that may not fit into conventional categories.\n\n3. **Cross-Verification of Information**:\n   - Recheck the URLs, authors, and publication dates for accuracy by comparing with the data retrieved from the arXiv results.\n\n4. **Verification of Markdown Table**:\n   - Validate the alignment and readability of the markdown table to ensure all columns are consistently formatted.\n\nLet me start by cross-verifying the abstracts and publication details. I'll provide a verification script for checking the consistency of URLs and publication details, assuming these were collected from the arXiv dataset.\n\n'''python\nimport arxiv\n\n# Define the list of paper URLs to verify details\npaper_urls = [\n    \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13485v1\",\n    \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13405v1\",\n    \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13410v1\",\n    # Add more URLs as needed\n]\n\n# Verify each paper's details\nfor url in paper_urls:\n    paper_id = url.split('/')[-1]\n    paper_info = next(arxiv.Search(id_list=[paper_id]).results())\n    print(f\"Title: {paper_info.title}\")\n    print(f\"Authors: {', '.join(author.name for author in paper_info.authors)}\")\n    print(f\"Published Date: {paper_info.published.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}\")\n    print(f\"URL: {paper_info.entry_id}\\n\")\n'''\n\nWould you like me to execute this verification, or is there another specific point of accuracy you wish to address?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExpert_summoner (to CaptainAgent):\n\nExpert_summoner (to CaptainAgent):\n\n***** Response from calling tool (call_0n4kwgY2tWt9jfGLvmKpQscq) *****\n# Response from seek_agent_help:\n## Task\nThe task is to collect recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications published on arXiv in the last week, categorize them into different domains, create a markdown table, and identify future research directions based on the collected data.\n\n## Results\n1.

Detecting AI-generated images is crucial for\\nmitigating these risks. Detection methods can be broadly categorized into\\npassive and watermark-based approaches: passive detectors rely on artifacts\\npresent in AI-generated images, whereas watermark-based detectors proactively\\nembed watermarks into such images. A key question is which type of detector\\nperforms better in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. However,\\nthe current literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of this issue. In\\nthis work, we aim to bridge that gap by developing ImageDetectBench, the first\\ncomprehensive benchmark to compare the effectiveness, robustness, and\\nefficiency of passive and watermark-based detectors. Our benchmark includes\\nfour datasets, each containing a mix of AI-generated and non-AI-generated\\nimages.

The experts planned to collect recent papers, categorize them into domains like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction, Benchmarking and Evaluation, and Cross-Domain Applications, and create a markdown table. They also aimed to analyze the data to suggest future research directions.\n\nThe experts executed a Python script to collect papers from arXiv, but faced initial issues with the script due to deprecated methods and datetime comparison errors. These were resolved by updating the query parameters and methods. They successfully retrieved a list of papers with details such as titles, authors, publication dates, abstracts, and URLs. The experts verified the accuracy of the data and categorization, ensuring correct details and domain classification.\n\nThe results included a markdown table categorizing the papers and a summary of future research directions, which highlighted trends in cross-domain applications, the need for benchmarking and evaluation, ethical and societal implications, and efficiency and scalability improvements. The experts concluded with a comprehensive overview of the current state and potential advancements in LLM applications.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncaptain_user_proxy (to captain_agent):\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/user-guide/reference-agents/captainagent/#using-both-agent-library-and-tool-library","title":"Using Both Agent Library and Tool Library","text":"<p>Now let's retrieve from both agent library and tool library while building experts for nested chat.</p> <p>To run the following demo, it is required to install the dependencies from the tool library and obtain BING search api and Rapid API key for tools in library to fully function.

The comprehensive steps will involve identifying constraints, decision variables, and an objective function.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate Relevant Constraints\n1. **Capacity Limits**:\n   - Let \\( R \\) be the roasting capacity per day.\n   - Let \\( I \\) be the inventory capacity of raw coffee beans.\n   - Let \\( P \\) be the transportation capacity.\n\n2. **Roasting Times**:\n   - Each type of coffee bean has a specified roasting time.\n   - If \\( t_i \\) is the roasting time for the coffee type \\( i \\), then the total roasting time must not exceed available processing time per day.\n\n3. **Raw Material Availability**:\n   - Each coffee type \\( i \\) has a maximum supply \\( S_i \\) and minimum demand \\( D_i \\) over a given time period.\n\n4. **Inventory Levels**:\n   - Inventory levels should be maintained to meet demand but not exceed capacity.\n\n5. **Supply and Demand Balances**:\n   - The supply of roasted coffee must meet customer demand.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Decision Variables\n- Let \\( x_{ij} \\) be the quantity of coffee type \\( i \\) roasted for destination \\( j \\).\n- Let \\( y_i \\) denote the amount of inventory for coffee type \\( i \\).\n- Let \\( z_j \\) be a binary variable indicating whether destination \\( j \\) is supplied or not.\n- Let \\( w_i \\) represent the quantity of raw coffee beans purchased for type \\( i \\).\n\n### Step 3: Develop the Objective Function\nThe objective function could either minimize costs (such as production, storage, and transportation) or maximize revenue.

We want to find \\( E[M] \\), where \\( M = \\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \\).\n\nThe probability \\( P(M = k) \\) of the maximum being equal to \\( k \\) (where \\( k \\) ranges from 1 to 6) can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Probability that at least one die shows \\( k \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{at least one die shows } k) = 1 - P(\\text{all dice show less than } k) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{k-1}{6}\\right)^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Probability that all dice show \\( k \\) or less:**\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{all dice show } \\leq k) = \\left(\\frac{k}{6}\\right)^3\n   \\]\n\nThus, we find:\n\\[\nP(M = k) = P(\\text{all dice show } \\leq k) - P(\\text{all dice show } &lt; k) = \\left(\\frac{k}{6}\\right)^3 - \\left(\\frac{k-1}{6}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Present a Clear Formula\n\nThe expected value can be computed as:\n\\[\nE[M] = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} k \\cdot P(M = k)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Specific Values\n\nPlugging in the specific \\( k \\) values (1 through 6):\n\n1. For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( P(M = 1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{216} \\)\n2. For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( P(M = 2) = \\frac{7}{216} \\)\n3. For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( P(M = 3) = \\frac{19}{216} \\)\n4. For \\( k = 4 \\): \\( P(M = 4) = \\frac{37}{216} \\)\n5. For \\( k = 5 \\): \\( P(M = 5) = \\frac{61}{216} \\)\n6. For \\( k = 6 \\): \\( P(M = 6) = \\frac{91}{216} \\)\n\n### Full Calculation\n\nUsing these probabilities in the expected value formula, we summarize:\n\\[\nE[M] = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{216} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{7}{216} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{19}{216} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{37}{216} + 5 \\cdot \\frac{61}{216} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{91}{216}\n\\]\nCalculating gives:\n\\[\nE[M] = \\frac{1071}{216} \\approx 4.96\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately **4.96**. The calculations demonstrate the application of both combinatorial analysis and probability theory to arrive at the expected value.\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"docs/user-guide/reference-agents/reasoningagent/#visualizing-the-reasoning-tree","title":"Visualizing the Reasoning Tree","text":""},{"location":"docs/user-guide/reference-agents/reasoningagent/#installation-of-graphviz","title":"Installation of Graphviz","text":"<p>To visualize the reasoning tree, you need to install Graphviz.

Below is an outline of how the calculations work theoretically, followed by a brief explanation of how you could validate with a simulation.\n\n### Theoretical Calculation\n\n1. **Probability Distribution**:\n   For a single roll of a 6-sided die, the outcomes are equally likely: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The probability of each face is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\n2. **Maximum Value**:\n   Let \\( X \\) be the maximum value of three rolls of a die. We need to find \\( E[X] \\), the expected maximum value.\n\n3. **Calculating the CDF**:\n   The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the maximum of three rolled dice can be calculated as follows:\n   - Calculate the probability that the maximum \\( X \\) is less than or equal to some value \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     P(X \\leq x) = P(\\text{all three rolls} \\leq x)\n     \\]\n   The probability that one die is less than or equal to \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{x}{6} \\), so:\n   \\[\n   P(X \\leq x) = \\left(\\frac{x}{6}\\right)^3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the expected value**:\n   The expected maximum can be derived from its probability mass function (PMF):\n   \\[\n   E[X] = \\sum_{x=1}^{6} P(X = x) \\cdot x\n   \\]\n   where \\( P(X = x) \\) is obtained from the CDF:\n   \\[\n   P(X = x) = P(X \\leq x) - P(X \\leq (x-1)) = \\left(\\frac{x}{6}\\right)^3 - \\left(\\frac{x-1}{6}\\right)^3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculation**:\n   Calculate for \\( x = 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   E[X] = \\sum_{x=1}^{6} \\left( \\left(\\frac{x}{6}\\right)^3 - \\left(\\frac{x-1}{6}\\right)^3 \\right) x\n   \\]\n   After calculating \\( E[X] \\), you will find that:\n   \\[\n   E[X] = \\frac{91}{18} \\approx 5.0556\n   \\]\n\n### Simulation Approach\n\n1. **Simulate Rolling the Die**:\n   - Roll a 6-sided die three times and record the maximum.\n   - Repeat this process (e.g., 10,000 times).\n\n2. **Calculate Average of Maximums**:\n   After 10,000 simulations, compute the average of the maximum values obtained from each simulation.\n\n3. **Compare Results**:\n   Compare the empirical average from simulations to the theoretical expected maximum calculated.\n\n### Conclusion\nUsing this combination of theoretical calculations and simulations, you can confidently determine that the expected maximum value from three rolls of a 6-sided die is approximately \\( 5.05 \\). Both the analytical and empirical methods will yield similar results, confirming the correctness of your calculations.\nuser_proxy (to mcts_agent):\n\nWhat is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmcts_agent (to tot_thinker):\n\n## Here are some previous trajectories and reflections\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Question:\nWhat is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?\n---\n\n---\nWhat are the possible next steps?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ntot_thinker (to mcts_agent):\n\nREFLECTION:\nThe previous steps have not been provided, so I can't comment on the specific actions taken.

Adjust cell output settings...\nTo find the expected maximum value of rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can use probability theory effectively.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Expected Maximum Value\n\nLet \\( X_1, X_2, X_3 \\) be the outcomes of the three rolls. We want to find \\( E[M] \\), where \\( M = \\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \\).\n\nThe probability \\( P(M = k) \\) of the maximum being equal to \\( k \\) (where \\( k \\) ranges from 1 to 6) can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Probability that at least one die shows \\( k \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{at least one die shows } k) = 1 - P(\\text{all dice show less than } k) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{k-1}{6}\\right)^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Probability that all dice show \\( k \\) or less:**\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{all dice show } \\leq k) = \\left(\\frac{k}{6}\\right)^3\n   \\]\n\nThus, we find:\n\\[\nP(M = k) = P(\\text{all dice show } \\leq k) - P(\\text{all dice show } &lt; k) = \\left(\\frac{k}{6}\\right)^3 - \\left(\\frac{k-1}{6}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Present a Clear Formula\n\nThe expected value can be computed as:\n\\[\nE[M] = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} k \\cdot P(M = k)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Specific Values\n\nPlugging in the specific \\( k \\) values (1 through 6):\n\n1. For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( P(M = 1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{216} \\)\n2. For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( P(M = 2) = \\frac{7}{216} \\)\n3. For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( P(M = 3) = \\frac{19}{216} \\)\n4. For \\( k = 4 \\): \\( P(M = 4) = \\frac{37}{216} \\)\n5. For \\( k = 5 \\): \\( P(M = 5) = \\frac{61}{216} \\)\n6. For \\( k = 6 \\): \\( P(M = 6) = \\frac{91}{216} \\)\n\n### Full Calculation\n\nUsing these probabilities in the expected value formula, we summarize:\n\\[\nE[M] = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{216} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{7}{216} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{19}{216} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{37}{216} + 5 \\cdot \\frac{61}{216} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{91}{216}\n\\]\nCalculating gives:\n\\[\nE[M] = \\frac{1071}{216} \\approx 4.96\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately **4.96**. The calculations demonstrate the application of both combinatorial analysis and probability theory to arrive at the expected value.\nuser_proxy (to Writer):\n\nWrite a concise but engaging blogpost about Nvidia.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWriter (to user_proxy):\n\n**Title: Nvidia: The Powerhouse of Visual Computing and AI Innovation**\n\nIn a world increasingly defined by digital experiences, Nvidia stands as a titan, driving the future of technology with its groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing.
